          # Configuration Introduction

          ## Requirements

          1. JSON syntax knowledge's.
          2. About ~1 minute for reading this.

          ## Witty notes and tips

          1. If you have a problem with configuration just remove it, server will re-create that.
          2. Before doing 1 variant, check your configuration for syntax errors.
          3. Some world specific configurations stores in \`ProjectEssentials\\<world-name>\`.
          4. Configuration stores in \`.\\config\\ProjectEssentials\` directory.

          # Configuration Description

          ## general.properties

          ### This configuration related to core module also has a regular java properties type.

          ### Syntax excursion

          - Define an empty list: \`[]\`
          - Define an filled list: \`["1", "2", "3"]\` (\`"\` can be removed).
          - Commentary starts with symbol \`#\`.

          ## native-mappings.json

          ### This configuration controlling native command permissions and aliases mappings.

          1. \`permissions\` object has type a \`Map\` with key type \`String\` and value type also \`String\`.

          \`\`\`json
            "ban": "native.moderation.ban@3"
          \`\`\`

          \`ban\` is property (key), - command which you want change permission.
          \`native.moderation.ban@3\` - is value of property, \`@\` symbol separate permission node and min required op level.

          If you will remove this core will use generated permission basing on command name, e.g for ban command it will \`native.ban\` and operator level by vanilla.

          2. \`aliases\` object has type like \`permissions\` object.

          \`\`\`json
            "locate": "find,where"
          \`\`\`

          \`locate\` is target command for applying aliases.
          \`find,where\` is aliases to apply for \`locate\` command.
